#  Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and insights related to passenger survival.

##  Files

- `EDAtitanic.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all code and visualizations.
- `AGE DISTRIBUTION BY SURVIVAL.png` – Box plot image showing age distribution by survival status.

##  Key Objectives

- Understand the structure and features of the Titanic dataset
- Analyze survival rates across different passenger attributes
- Visualize relationships between:
  - Age and survival
  - Gender and survival
  - Passenger class (Pclass)
  - Embarkation point
  - Fare and other continuous features

##  EDA Techniques Used

- Missing value analysis
- Statistical summary
- Box plots
- Count plots
- Histograms and distribution plots
- Correlation heatmap

##  Insights

- Women had a higher survival rate than men
- Children and upper-class passengers were more likely to survive
- Age distribution shows similar medians for survivors and non-survivors, but survivors include a wider age range

##  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Dataset

- Dataset used: [Titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) or `train.csv`

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-eda.git
   cd titanic-eda
2.Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook EDAtitanic.ipynb
